- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex and for now I'll leave this page pretty much as default as possible.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in any type of software development.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I possibly can. Mostly programming languages I never used or heard of.
- ğŸ’¾ This page is meant to contain some of the code and projects that were helpful to me in the past and might be helpful to others as well.
