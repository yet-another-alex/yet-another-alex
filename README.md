Started with C/C++ and Java during university, went on to do C# .NET and Python. I'm trying to learn pretty much everything from Fortran to Golang to Swift. This page is supposed to document some of the side projects and code that might be useful to others.

<h2 align="center">About Me</h2><br />
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex.<br />
ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª I'm from Soest, Germany, where I work and live. I speak German, English and some leftovers of French and Japanese.<br />
ðŸ’» I currently work with realtime databases and mostly do administration work. When it comes to coding, I'm currently invested in Python for the simplicity and development speed. Ongoing learning: golang and FP/Lazarus.<br />
ðŸ•¹ I got into software development because I wanted to develop games. After Game Maker, I started with PyGame, Unity and Godot. You can find some of my older GameJam entries on my itch.io above.<br />
ðŸ–¥ When it comes to private projects, I try to develop tools that will make my daily life easier - e.g. <a href="https://github.com/yet-another-alex/excel-report-evaluator">bulk evaluation of Excel reports</a>.<br />
ðŸ“‹ All the code I upload is meant to be helpful to others in some way or another.<br />
ðŸ“¨ If you have any questions, request or really just anything, please @ me.<br />
